# HOST2023
This site is for HOST class, spring 2023. You will use this site to share provisioning data initially

Each of you should push 4 files up into ProvisionData, where each file is given a unique name with the 'Cxx' corresponding to the chip number I have assigned to you in class. You will generate this data using the instructions in the Provisioning lab.
